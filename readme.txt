This plugin is a simple plugin to generate widgets highlighting top products available on Apple iTunes Store.

== Description ==

This plugin is a simple plugin to generate widgets highlighting top mac apps, music, books, ios apps, audiobooks and university courses available on Apple iTunes Store. This is in development, but provides a starting point for experienced developers who want to customize the widget to their needs. At this time, the plugin does not support affiliate links but will in the near future. 

Future versions will include a fully documented shortcode, which will allow placement of top products on both posts and pages.
